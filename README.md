# pfisheries

This project is a conversion of the original R project rfisheries by Karthik Ram, Carl Boettiger and Andrew Dyck. The original project can be found here: https://github.com/ropensci/rfisheries. 

This package provides programmatic access to the Open Fisheries API. Open Fisheries is a platform that aggregates global fishery data and currently offers global fish capture landings from 1950 onwards. Read more about that effort [here](https://www.openfisheries.org).
